title: Schema Validation for YAML
short_name: YAML

highlighting_language: yaml
description_blurb: is a powerful data serialization language that aims to be human friendly.  Most JSON is syntactically valid YAML, but idiomatic YAML follows very different conventions.  While YAML has advanced features that cannot be directly mapped to JSON, most YAML files use features that can be validated by JSON Schema.  JSON Schema is the most portable and broadly supported choice for YAML validation.
